# CodeBuddy: The AI Logic Tutor & Lab Assistant 🎓🤖

**Team Name:** Viper_Coders  
**Problem Statement:** AI for Learning & Developer Productivity  
**Track:** Student Track
---

## 🚀 Project Overview
**CodeBuddy** is an AI-powered educational tool designed to help Computer Science students move beyond simple syntax fixing. Unlike standard AI tools that just give the answer, CodeBuddy focuses on **"Debugging Logic"** rather than just **"Debugging Syntax."**

It bridges the gap between writing code and understanding concepts, specifically targeting the anxiety students face during practical lab exams.

## 💡 Key Features
- **🧠 Smart Logic Debugger:** Uses **Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3 Sonnet)** to explain *why* code failed in simple English.
- **🎤 Viva Prep Mode:** Automatically generates "Viva Voce" (Interview) questions based on the student's specific code snippet.
- **📚 Resource Mapper:** Suggests specific documentation and learning resources for the identified logic gaps.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **AI Model:** Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3 Sonnet)
- **Coding Assistant:** Amazon Q
- **Backend:** AWS Lambda (Python) & Amazon API Gateway
- **Database:** Amazon DynamoDB
- **Frontend:** React.js
